                        <p>Kegel exercises are simple yet highly effective for strengthening the pelvic floor muscles. These muscles support the bladder, uterus, and bowels, and play a crucial role in childbirth and postpartum recovery. To perform Kegels, you can sit, stand, or lie down comfortably. Contract the muscles you would use to stop the flow of urine, without squeezing the buttocks or thighs. Hold the contraction for 5-10 seconds, then release and relax for an equal amount of time. Aim to complete 10-15 repetitions, gradually increasing the hold time as you progress. Kegel exercises can be done discreetly throughout the day and are an essential component of pelvic health during pregnan</p>
