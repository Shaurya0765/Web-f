                            <li>Swing your arms naturally to increase calorie burn and engage upper body muscles.</li>

                        <p>Walking is one of the safest and easiest forms of cardiovascular exercise for pregnant women. It's low-impact, gentle on the joints, and can be easily adjusted to your fitness level. You can walk outdoors, on a treadmill, or even in a shopping mall if weather conditions aren't favorable. Aim for at least 30 minutes of brisk walking most days of the week. If you're new to exercise, start with shorter durations and gradually increase as tolerated.</p>

                            <li>Provides a full-body workout with minimal impact on joints.</li>
                            <li>Helps relieve back pain and swelling associated with pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>Start with a few laps of freestyle or breaststroke, gradually increasing distance and intensity.</li>
                            <li>Use proper breathing techniques, inhaling through your mouth and exhaling through your nose or mouth while your face is submerged.</li>

                        <p>Swimming is an excellent full-body workout that's gentle on the joints and provides resistance without impact.

Try swimming laps, water aerobics classes specifically designed for pregnant women, or simply enjoy moving around in the water. Aim for 20-30 minutes of swimming at a moderate intensity.</p>
