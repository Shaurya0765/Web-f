                        <h3>Squats</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart or slightly wider, toes pointing slightly outward.</li>
                            <li>Engage your core muscles and keep your back straight.</li>
                            <li>Lower your body by bending your knees and hips, as if you're sitting back into a chair.</li>
                            <li>Keep your knees aligned with your toes and lower down as far as comfortable or until your thighs are parallel to the ground.</li>
                            <li>Press through your heels to return to the starting position.</li>
                            <li>Aim for 2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions, adjusting the depth of your squat based on your comfort level.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>Squats are an excellent exercise for building strength in the lower body, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. They also engage the core muscles for stability and balance. During pregnancy, squats can help prepare your body for the physical demands of labor and childbirth. It's important to maintain proper form throughout the movement to avoid strain on the lower back and knees. If you experience discomfort or pelvic pain while performing squats, you can modify the exercise by using a stability ball against a wall for support or reducing the range of motion.</p>

                        <h3>Modified push-ups</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stand facing a wall or find an elevated surface like a countertop.</li>
                            <li>Place your hands shoulder-width apart on the wall or surface.</li>
                            <li>Step your feet back to create a straight line from head to heels.</li>
                            <li>Lower your chest towards the wall or surface by bending your elbows.</li>
                            <li>Push through your palms to return to the starting position..</li>
                            <li>Perform 2-3 sets of 8-12 repetitions.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </div>
                            <p>Push-ups can be beneficial for pregnant women as part of a modified exercise routine. While traditional push-ups may become challenging as pregnancy progresses due to the increasing weight and changes in the body, modified push-ups against a wall or on an elevated surface can still offer significant benefits. Push-ups help strengthen the chest, shoulders, arms, and core muscles, which are essential for maintaining good posture and supporting the body during pregnancy and labor. Strengthening these muscle groups can also alleviate discomfort associated with the changes in posture and weight distribution that occur during pregnancy. Additionally, a strong upper body can assist with daily activities such as lifting and carrying, which may become more challenging as the pregnancy advances. However, it's crucial for pregnant women to listen to their bodies, avoid overexertion, and consult with their healthcare provider before starting or continuing any exercise regimen during pregnancy. Proper form and alignment are key to preventing injury and ensuring the safety and effectiveness of push-ups or any other exercise performed during pregnancy.</p>

                                            <h3>Lunges</h3>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Stand with your feet hip-width apart.</li>
                                                <li>Take a step forward with one foot and lower your body until both knees are bent at a 90-degree angle.</li>
                                                <li>Keep your front knee aligned with your ankle and your back knee pointing toward the floor.</li>
                                                <li>Push through your front heel to return to the starting position.</li>
                                                <li>Alternate legs and repeat.</li>
                                                <li>Perform 2-3 sets of 10-12 repetitions on each leg.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p>Lunges are a particularly valuable exercise for pregnant women due to their multifaceted benefits. Not only do lunges help to maintain and improve lower body strength, they also promote balance, stability, and flexibility â€“ all crucial aspects of prenatal fitness. By engaging major muscle groups such as the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves, lunges aid in supporting the added weight and shifting center of gravity experienced during pregnancy. This strengthening effect can alleviate common discomforts like lower back pain and pelvic instability.</p>
